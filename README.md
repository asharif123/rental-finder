## Description
This project serves to explore available rental properties across the United States. As some companies adopt a work from home policy, many people have used this opportunity to move to other cities. Our project facilitates this search. 

Our motivation was to challenge ourselves by improving on the idea of our first project, by building the front and back end to produce full application our users can interact with. 

We built a functioning, useful, and fully deployed application. The purpose of creating Rental Finders is to produce an application for users who are looking for a new home. Inspired by the California exodus, we thought of an easy to use property search website. We believe this would be useful for this current trend . The easy to navigate platform and asthetically pleasing user interface will entice the user to engage with this application for their future home search. 

- What problem does it solve?

By building the back end of our application we were able to retreive listing data and create/store our user data to create authentication. 

- What did you learn?

We learned how to utilize Express.js to handle different methods in an API routes. This allowed us to handle reponses that the client requests .  With Express.js we handled our GET and POST request.
we also learned how to implement SQL for our database and seed the database. In addition creating and seeding the database, we used Sequelize to communicate with mySQL.
Another subject we learned and implemented was Model-View-Controller. We structured our codebase in three different sections, exercising the philsophy known as seperation of concerns. In the Model we structured our database and logic for data retrieval . In Model is where we implemented Sequelize (ORM) for database queries.  In the View, we dynamically generated HTML using Handlebar.js templete engine. Finally, in Controller we seperated the client-side and the server-side routes . The Controller handler user input and interacts with Model to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)
